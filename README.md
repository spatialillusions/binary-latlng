# binary-latlng
Functions for converting Latitude/Longitude to/from a fixed number of bits

## Introduction

This library is for converting LatLngs to numbers representing them as a fixed width binary representations. This is a very compact way to store LatLngs and is described by **National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA)** in the document called **Time-Space-Position Information (TSPI)**.

Binary representations of LatLngs are used with several different precisions in Variable Message Format (VMF).
