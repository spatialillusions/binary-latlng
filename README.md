# binary-latlng
Functions for converting Latitude/Longitude to/from a fixed number of bits

## Introduction

This library is for converting LatLngs to numbers representing them as unsigned integers with a specific precision. In this way LatLngs can be stored as binary using as few bits as possible.

This way of storing LatLngs is described by **National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA)** in the document called **Time-Space-Position Information (TSPI)** NGA.STND.0019_2.0.

Binary representations of LatLngs are used with several different precisions in Variable Message Format (VMF).
